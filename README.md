# UNR-2025-GameJam
CLONE the repo first like in class
Workflow:
Each person work on own branch.

To create branch, 
    git checkout -b branch_name

After coding, push it.
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add keyboard input"
    git push -u origin branch_name

After you've done git push -u... can now just do git push and git pull without the retyping that branch name.
Note: For a future, new branch, must redo git push -u origin new_branch, and only then can you do git push and git pull without the branch name.
